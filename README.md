# Deprecation Announcement 12/12/2022

On 12/12/2022 we announced the deprecation of [TAL](https://github.com/bbc/tal/), on which this repository is based.
This will allow us to concentrate on future work, which we hope to share details of soon.

We apologise that we were not active in keeping the TAL community up to date with the status of the
project. Going forward, we will provide regular updates on the future of TAL. 

As part of the deprecation, pull requests will be disabled and outstanding issues will be closed as with the parent repository.
TAL or this example will not be actively maintained. 

We will answer any questions found in the issues backlog as best we can. There will soon be a email address you
can use to contact us. This readme will be updated when this becomes available.
